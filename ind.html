      <h3 id="essay1-reflection">Essay 1: My Late and Transformative Reading Journey</h3>
      <img src="asiof.jpg" alt="A Song of Ice and Fire book collection" class="essay-image">
      <p>I never liked reading growing up. In fact, I almost despised it. In school, reading was always reduced to
        comprehension tests, vocabulary memorization, and tedious summaries. It felt like a chore‚Äîcold, lifeless, and
        disconnected from me.</p>
      <p>But something shifted when I picked up *A Game of Thrones* by George R.R. Martin, not for a school assignment,
        but for the sake up improving my poor English comprehension, reading and writing skills. I didn‚Äôt expect much,
        but I was curious why people were so obsessed with the series. The first few pages were hard. The sentences were
        dense, the world foreign. But then‚Ä¶ something clicked. I got hooked on the politics, the flawed characters, and
        the grim reality they faced. For the first time, I found myself immersed in a world that didn‚Äôt feel forced. I
        kept reading. Then writing. Then imagining my own stories.</p>
      <p>That book opened the floodgates. I started reading voraciously: fantasy, essays, classics, even literary
        criticism. Words became something I craved‚Äînot just to understand SAT passages, but to build worlds, convey
        emotions, and understand people. I started small by writing fan fiction, and now I‚Äôm drafting my original
        fantasy novel. It‚Äôs messy, chaotic, and imperfect‚Äîbut it‚Äôs mine.</p>
      <div class="quote">‚ÄúI started small by writing fan fiction... now I‚Äôm drafting my original fantasy novel.‚Äù</div>
      <p> When I reflect upon how transformative this journey has been for my academic career as well as for my personal
        growth, it feels strange to remember that I had no interest in reading until my goal pushed me to start doing
        it. If I hadn't embraced that challenge back then, I would have missed out on so many great opportunities that I
        was able to grab and those that are still available to me. This really goes to show how allowing and embracing
        new life experiences, regardless of how late, can create opportunities for personal growth and success.

      <h3 id="essay2-reflection">Essay 2: The Feeling of Failures and Success</h3>
      <img src="cover.png" alt="College struggle and success"
        class="essay-image">
      <p>This piece dives deep into my emotional and mental challenges during the college application process. It was
        easily the darkest and most uncertain period of my life. Rejections from colleges and scholarship
        disappointments hit harder than I expected‚Äînot because they closed doors, but because they made me question my
        self-worth.</p>
      <p>One of the hardest things I had to do was tell people I didn‚Äôt get in. That I wasn‚Äôt chosen. That I had worked
        so hard, and it didn‚Äôt matter. But I realized: it did matter. Not in the way I thought, but in the way I grew.
        The experience was brutal, no doubt about it, but it taught me struggle, persseverance and and appriciation of
        the good things that happened in my life.
      </p>
      <p>Eventually, I found my place at Howard University. It wasn‚Äôt the school I initially dreamed of, but it became
        the school I was meant to be at. I connected with people, found mentors, and discovered a deeper version of
        myself. I learned how to fail without being a failure.</p>
      <div class="quote">‚ÄúI chose to be the writer of my faith rather than let my faith dictate my life‚Ä¶‚Äù</div>
      <p>Writing about this pain helped me process it. It gave me closure, and more importantly, clarity. Success isn‚Äôt
        just about getting in. It‚Äôs about getting through. It‚Äôs not something I win. It‚Äôs something I build‚Äîevery day,
        with effort, heart, and a whole lot of hope.</p>

      <h2>Shared Themes and Broader Lessons</h2>
      <p> These two pieces describe different but overlapping pieces in my life, If I hadn't started my reading journey,
        I wouldn't have done well in the SATs which was the beginning of my second piece.
        Though Essay 1 and Essay 2 differ in subject, they converge on important life lessons. At their core, both
        stories represent a kind of journey‚Äîone intellectual and creative, the other emotional and existential. But both
        journeys forced me to confront who I was and who I wanted to be.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Transformation:</strong> Each story reflects how I evolved‚Äîwhether through developing a passion for
          reading or navigating crushing setbacks. Both experiences reshaped how I think, act, and dream.</li>
        <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> Whether it was pushing through rejecting initial failures in the SAT or picking
          myself up after
          rejections, resilience was at the heart of every turning point in my journey.</li>
        <li><strong>Growth Through Discomfort:</strong> In both stories, my biggest moments of change came from times
          when I was uncomfortable‚Äîlearning to read critically or facing the fear of failure. Discomfort became my
          catalyst for growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Identity:</strong> Both essays explore how I started becoming who I am today‚Äîsomeone who embraces
          the power of storytelling, someone who fights for his future, and someone who is continuously evolving.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
      <p>Most importantly, I‚Äôve learned that our journeys often don‚Äôt go as planned, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt
        meaningful.  They shape us in unexpected, beautiful ways. These essays tell the
        story of how I became someone who
        doesn‚Äôt just dream, but also acts‚Äîand someone who doesn‚Äôt run from failure, but grows from it. When I started reading books, I didn't know I'd end up writing my own stories and I obviously didn't
        see myself at a great school like Howard. If I had given in to despair and hopelessness, I would't have been part of these beautiful things. My life lesson is: You don't always know where your hardwork will take you, but struggling despite failures and perssevering will always be worth it </p>
      <p>Writing these two very personal pieces of writing has had a profound impact on me. I come from a culture which
        prioritises community at the cost of individuality. We are not taught to speak, think and write for ourselves.
        At the beginning of this school year, I was therefore hesitant to be writing so much about my journies and
        experences. But as a complete my freshman year, I feel much more confident to do it </p>
      <p><strong>Final Words:</strong> Life will always throw challenges our way ‚Äî some that we see coming and others
        that catch us completely off guard. But within every challenge lies a lesson, and within every setback lies the
        potential for breakthrough. My story is far from over, but if there's one thing I know now, it‚Äôs that I will
        continue to grow, reflect, and keep moving forward ‚Äî with purpose, with passion, and with hope.</p>
